            <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>My name is Zach Watford. I am a sophomore Psychology major at the Universtiy of South Carolina, with a minor in Environmental 
        Studies. I was born in Tampa, Florida, on November 1, 2002, and moved to Cincinnati, Ohio when I was around six months old. I have one 
        brother and two sisters, who are 22, 19, and 17, respectively. At home, I have four pets: A border collie named Penelope, a pitbull named 
        Gemma, a mastiff named Rambo, and an orange cat called Oliver.</p>
        <p id="about-me" class="hidden">I chose to come to South Carolina because of the weather and the campus. I knew since I was a kid that I wanted to go south for college,
        and my first choice was Universtiy of Florida. However, all that changed when I visited the campus here. The whole thing was beautiful, from
        the horseshoe to most of the classroom buildings, and I was accepted into the honors college, so my choice was clear. I graduated high school
        in 2021 and moved down to start college. </p>

    <h3>My Future Career Plans</h3>
        <p>After I finish undergrad, I plan to attend some sort of graduate school. My options include a master's degree in Psychology or law 
        school. From there, I can go two ways. If I go to law school, I need to pick a specialty, which I am unsure of at this time, but I am planning on 
        doing some sort of contract law. If I go to grad school for Psychology, I can get a job as a therapist, an HR specialist, or continue my education 
        and get a PHD.</p>
        <p id = "about-career" class="hidden">Other than these two options, I have considered pursuing a minor in computer science. With this minor and a Psychology major, I can 
        go into UX design using my knowledge of human behaior and preferences and coding skill to help companies make themselves more 
        accessible to the average consumer. However, if I do this, I need to take more computer science classes and possibly extend my stay 
        in school.</p>
